                            This project was helping to rebuild from scratch, Dunnhumby's core data science platform with modern technologies such as .NET Core, Google Cloud Platform, Docker, Kubernetes and React.
                            My role as a senior software engineer was to design and develop some middle tier and backend services utilising .NET Core. The services hooked into GCP PubSub messaging queues and a PostgresSQL database.

                            My role at Ofqual as a senior web developer was to design and build from scratch a fully working single page web application that would allow Ofqual to manage awarding organisations across England and Wales and to handle their accreditation process.
                            React was choosen for the front end applicatyion and Node was used to build out the backend API. The application was hosted on the Micrtosoft Azure Cloud and services like CosmosDB, Azure AD and Azure Search were utilised within the application.
                            The application was sucessfully delivered into production and is now live.
